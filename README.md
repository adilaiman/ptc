### 2.2 Running Meteor
```BASH
Before running the app, make sure to add your Google Maps API key in the file located
client/main.html

The key needs to be placed in the script indicated by

### 2.4 Run Meteor Mocha Code Coverage
```BASH
meteor npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-istanbul

BABEL_ENV=COVERAGE COVERAGE=1 COVERAGE_VERBOSE=1 COVERAGE_APP_FOLDER=$PWD/ TEST_WATCH=1 meteor test --driver-package meteortesting:mocha

http://localhost:3000/coverage
```

If you do not see any green on the code coverage page, please refresh the page, as code coverage takes a small amount of time to load before generating an up to date html document.

## 3 Epilogue
### 3.1 Post Challenge Footnotes
Fun challenge! However since I do not have any time other than the weekends, I have hacked this up during these 2 days. Other than unit tests the app has not been thouroughly tested and it's my first time using MaterializeCSS, so some bugs üêõ are bound to appear!

### 3.2 Improvements
Listed below are a list of improvements I would make, if this was a full time project.
- [ ] Check marker validity, some markers do not work because data isn't returned from the API
- [ ] Implement a way to make clusters of markers more visible and easier to select
- [ ] Implement a user account system with pagination for the appointments page
- [ ] Use Bootstrap üòÇ, from this experiment with MaterializeCSS, there's less tools such as multiple modals which Bootstrap has. Furthermore, some of the default responsive design is bugged in my app.
- [ ] Design a proper schema for the collections
